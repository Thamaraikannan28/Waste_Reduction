<h1 align="center">Food Waste Reduction</h1>


## :innocent: What is the problem?

We are facing many different challenges across the world such as environmental accidents, global warming and industrial pollution but wastage of food is also one of the most important challenge that many of us are not aware of. Recent global study says that the maximum wastage of fruits and vegetables (around 20 percent) happens during retail and consumption. Therefore, the consumers and retailers plays a major role not only in the reduction of food waste but also contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals to resolve hunger and malnutrition, and also reduce food waste across the globe by 2030. 

## :thinking: How can technology help?

 In order to control this, a simple change can be made with the help of sensors which is an IoT based system in addition with the Machine Learning algorithm. This change will not only be helpful in preserving the nation's economy but also helps in serving the people with hunger and malnutrition. 
 
## :bulb: Idea

  The idea is to create an IOT based system with sensors and microcontroller for the real time monitoring of the temperature, humidity and methane gas emission by the fruits and vegetables which are carried over long distance. The data will be sent to the IBM cloud for further analysis and prediction. The users will be provided with the application or the website in order to monitor during long distance transportation of fruits and vegetables. The user will be notified with an alert message if the food items start rotting. This will definitely help us in preventing the food waste about 40% in our daily life.
